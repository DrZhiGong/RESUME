        <h2>Some useful skills and experience</h2>

        <p>Via the training I have received, I get a command of these skills below:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Fluency in the use of regular laboratory instruments</li>
          <li>Good command of origin, SPSS, matlab to process experimental data</li>
          <li>Dare to explore new areas, good at learning and willing to learn</li>
          <li>Ability to analyze and interpret experimental data</li>
          <li>Fully stimulate enthusiasm for electrochemistry and other fields</li>
    
  </ul>

        <h2>Daily Time</h2>

        <p>During my nearly two years at school, I enjoyed exploring the unknown, learning about it and explaining the fun it brings, and I also enjoyed playing basketball, jogging and other sports. At the same time, I often participated in a series of academic competitions and listened to lectures of academicians in the school. I also participate in offline academic conferences. Now I am 17 years old, even if I am already a sophomore, but my love for chemistry has never been shaken since that night 9 years ago!</p>
